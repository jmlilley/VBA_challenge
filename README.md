# VBA_challenge

The goal of this homework was to loop through the stock data for each year on 3 separate worksheets in excel using VBA scripting.

On each worksheet, an output should be displayed that shows each unique ticker along with its associated yearly change, percent change for the year, and total stock volume.
  Conditional formating should be used on the yearly change to indicate whether it was positive or negative.
  
Additionally, display the ticker and associated values for the stocks with the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease, and greatest total volume for each year.
